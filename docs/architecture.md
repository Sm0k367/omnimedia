# OmniMedia AI Architecture

## Overview

OmniMedia AI is a microservices-based AI media generation platform that orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to create high-quality videos, images, audio, and text content.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Orchestrator Service (Port 8000)
- **Purpose**: Main coordination service that manages media generation requests
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Receives media generation requests
  - Coordinates with specialized services
  - Tracks task progress and status
  - Returns results to clients

### 2. Image Service (Port 8001)
- **Purpose**: Handles image generation requests
- **AI Providers**: Stability AI, OpenAI DALL-E, Replicate
- **Features**:
  - Multiple resolution support (1024x1024 to 2048x2048)
  - Various artistic styles
  - Quality optimization

### 3. Video Service (Port 8002)
- **Purpose**: Manages video generation and processing
- **AI Providers**: Runway ML, Replicate
- **Features**:
  - Configurable duration (5-30 seconds)
  - Frame rate control (24 FPS default)
  - Quality settings

### 4. Audio Service (Port 8003)
- **Purpose**: Handles audio and voice generation
- **AI Providers**: ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS
- **Features**:
  - Voice synthesis
  - Music generation
  - Audio effects processing

### 5. Text Service (Port 8004)
- **Purpose**: Manages text generation and processing
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google AI
- **Features**:
  - Content generation
  - Text optimization
  - Multi-language support

## Communication Flow

1. Client sends request to Orchestrator Service
2. Orchestrator analyzes request and determines required services
3. Orchestrator dispatches subtasks to appropriate services
4. Services process requests using AI providers
5. Results are collected and returned to client

## Deployment Options

### Docker Compose
- Development and testing environment
- All services run in containers
- Easy local setup and testing

### Kubernetes
- Production deployment
- Scalable and resilient
- Load balancing and service discovery

### Direct Python Execution
- Development mode
- All services run as separate processes
- Quick iteration and debugging

## Configuration

Services are configured through environment variables:
- API keys for AI providers
- Service-specific settings (resolution, duration, etc.)
- Feature flags and fallback options

## Monitoring and Health Checks

Each service provides:
- `/health` endpoint for health monitoring
- Logging and error tracking
- Performance metrics
